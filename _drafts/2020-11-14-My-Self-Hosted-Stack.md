## Introduction

I've been meaning to start self-hosting a lot of the services I use on a regular basis by myself, but haven't really gotten around actually doing it. Every few months I would read an article about how companies are using data from users who use their products and it would make me want to switch, but it was enough of a hassle that I never actually took the plunge. Until this weekend.

A few days ago Google announced that they were removing the unlimited storage feature of Google Photos. I actually use that feature __a ton__. It also got me thinking of all the great [products](https://killedbygoogle.com/) that Google has also shut down over the years. If they decided to shut down Google Photos, Drive, Mail, etc. I would be ruined as basically all my digital data is backed up or stored in Google's ecosystem.

However, it works quite well, and everything works cohesively together in a way you can't really duplicate with a mishmash of different products from different companies spanning different ecosystems (Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc). Another reason I was reluctant to self-host, everything works together cohesively.

I haven't really solved that second problem (yet), but I have started working on my own self-hosted stack based off popular alternatives I found for tools I use everyday. I'm happy so far with what I have setup, but I will look into expanding into more tools once I know my current setup is stable.

## Overview

I started brainstorming what tools I normally use on a daily basis.
