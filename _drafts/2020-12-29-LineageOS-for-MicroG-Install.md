I have a Pixel 4, and I have been debating installing either [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) or [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) on it for a while. Then I found out about something called [microG](https://microg.org/). It basically provides open-source free-as-in-freedom alternatives to the proprietary APIs and services that Google provides for Android, such as through Google Play Services. They build their own version of LineageOS that comes bundled with their libraries. That ROM is called [LineageOS for microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) (yes, I know, it's a very clever name). I figured that would be a good step in the right direction for me to wean myself off of using Google's Android to using something that is more open-source and without as much of the invasive Google software.

This post is basically documenting my journey (even all the parts I screwed up).
