My main computer is my laptop: a Lenovo ThinkPad T450s.

I dual-boot both Windows 10 and Linux on it. I need both because I enjoy using Linux more, but I do need to use Windows fairly often for programs in my engineering courses, and certain utilities/programs which only run on Windows. Sometimes I wish I had a Mac, so I could also use OS X but I'm happy with my ThinkPad.

I was using Ubuntu 16.04 for the longest time, but I started getting those annoying Ubuntu errors that seem to plague everyone. I got very fed up with it all, and decided to recently do a fresh Linux reinstall. I'll be walking through everything I do to customize it to my liking, such as any settings, configurations, applications, etc.
