## I've recently gotten back into podcasts...

I've recently gotten back into podcasts, and I started listening to them during commutes and while working on other things. It's a nice way to keep updated on current events while doing other things or just taking a nice break. I use the [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/) app to listen to podcasts on the go.

Here are a few of my favorites at the moment, and I'll update this list if anything changes. These are in no particular order.

### [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/)

A series about design and it's influence and presence in our lives all around us.

### [From Scratch](http://www.npr.org/series/126166186/from-scratch)

An NPR series where founders/owners/other really cool people just talk about their lives and their work.

### [Inside the DesignLab](http://supplyframe.com/designlab)

A series where hardware developers talk about their projects and work.

### [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)

A series that talks about open source projects and their progress, usually with a member of the project's core team.

### [The Vergecast](https://art19.com/shows/vergecast)

I know people love to hate on The Verge, but this series isn't a terrible way for keeping updated on consumer technology/electronics.

### [Twenty Thousand Hertz](https://www.20k.org/)

A podcast which provides insight into sounds that people hear throughout the day, which you might normally not give a second thought.

### [We're Alive - A "Zombie" Story of Survival](http://www.werealive.com/)

This one is just for fun, a nice little story which I thought was cool and could get into.
