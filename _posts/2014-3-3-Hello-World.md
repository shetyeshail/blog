Hello! Just made this blog using the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. Super easy to setup. Also, I'm using [Prose](http://prose.io/) to edit this post with Markdown.

I'm not sure what I'm going to use this blog for yet, but it will probably end up being to track progress on personal projects or events I attend. Idk.
